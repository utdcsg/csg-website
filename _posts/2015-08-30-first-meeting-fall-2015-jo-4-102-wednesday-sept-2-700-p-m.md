Hey guys,

Hope everyone had a wonderful summer break! We will be having our first meeting on Wednesday September 2nd at 7:00 pm in the JO 4.102. Here is a map of the room for your convenience: [http://www.utdallas.edu/locator/JO\_4.102 ](http://www.utdallas.edu/locator/JO_4.102). We will have our special guest from Cyber Defense Labs, Kevin Henson, to present the topic of Social Engineering and have a fun activity.

We will also have our first Saturday open lab this Saturday Sept 5th from 12:00pm-4:00pm (but you can drop in at any time in between) in our lab at ECSS 4.619. Free Pizza will be provided and you can explore various areas of security with your peers.
